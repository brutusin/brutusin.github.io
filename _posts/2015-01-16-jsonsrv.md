Hi, today I have been working on [jsonsrv](https://github.com/brutusin/brutusin/blob/master/jsonsrv/README.md), a lightweight, jar-packaged, self-describing, JSON RPC service framework for JEE (servlet-based) for easily exposing your business methods through a JSON over HTTP API..

My team is going to recode our current web applications into a new ajax-json-rest approach and this component could play a central role.

Hope you enjoy it!

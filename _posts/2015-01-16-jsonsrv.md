Hi, today I have been working on [jsonsrv](https://github.com/brutusin/jsonsrv), java library to easily creating JSON web services over HTTP.

My team is going to recode our current web applications into a new ajax-json-rest approach and this component could play a central role. I liked the result so I have published it in github. 

>A self-describing, java web framework for easily exposing business methods as JSON RPC services over HTTP.
>Motivated by the creation of Javascript/AJAX/JSON web interfaces, the goal of this library is to allow a very simple and efficiently implementation of java services, and being able to execute them by HTTP POST and GET requests, and equally important, constitute a self-describing repository of services.

Hope you enjoy it!

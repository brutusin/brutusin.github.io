Hi, today I have been working on [jsonsrv](https://github.com/brutusin/brutusin/tree/master/jsonsrv), a lightweight, jar-packaged, json service framework for JEE.

My team is going to recode our current web applications into an ajax-json-rest new approach and this component could play a central role.

Hope you enjoy it!

Hi, my name is [Ignacio del Valle](https://es.gravatar.com/idelvall) and this is my personal website.

All began with my willing of opensourcing some [personal projects](https://github.com/brutusin) on GitHub, so I needed a namespace for my software components, and once chosen why not spend 10$ a year on a domain name?

Using my own name seemed to me too egocentric, so I picked the name basing on the name of my dog. Brutus gave me his very best, so it perfectly fits with the purpose of this site: giving you my best pieces of code.

So here it is brutusin.org, dedicated in loving memory of my best friend.
